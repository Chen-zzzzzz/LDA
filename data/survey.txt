What is one thing you wish was different about queue lines in Disney? This could be about their physical layout, how interactive they are, how you are informed of the wait time, etc.
wait times
Again, making video presentations within the line seem like a crucial part of the actual ride experience made a huge difference. 
more outdoors, if not possible then less maze-like
Only some rides have single riders and I wish more did as somtimes I would go on a ride by myself and it would cut down on the time and be more efficent as the ride would have the single empty seat filled.
Make them shorter
smell and crowded
Always better to be moving more than standing so some could be improved
I donâ€™t remember
No more unshaded segments of lines!! Protect me from the sun! Also I would love distance markers to protect riders personal space (like they had during COVID)
Just wish they were shorter
i wish there were places to sit or virtual queues
