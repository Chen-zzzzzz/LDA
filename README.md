## Setup

1.  **Create a Conda Environment (Recommended):**

    * Ensure that the `environment.yml` file is located in the root directory of your project (the same folder as your Python script).

    * Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.

    * **Navigate to your project directory:**

        ```bash
        cd /path/to/your/project/directory
        ```

        (Replace `/path/to/your/project/directory` with the actual path to your project folder.)

    * Run the following command to create the environment:

        ```bash
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        ```

    * Activate the environment:

        ```bash
        conda activate open_ended_analysis_env
        ```
